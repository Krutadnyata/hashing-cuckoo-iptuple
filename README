This is a git repository consisting of a library which hashes the ip addresses on the hash table using the ip tuple parameters.
I have implemented it using Cuckoo hashing technique.
The repository also contains two types of servers. 
The one server is using raw sockets to grep packets.
And the other server is only greping packets following TCP or UDP protocol.
The 2nd server is implemented using two ways i.e. Multithreaded approach as well as using poll() fuction.
